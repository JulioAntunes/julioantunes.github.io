                "Borderland Subversion" is an impactful art installation inspired by Carlos Barria's photograph depicting Maria Hernandez's immigration journey. The artwork explores the emotional separation of families during immigration.
            </p>
            <p class="SynopsisParagraph">
                A borderland serves as an imaginary space that separates two distinct areas or worlds, while subversion, as a manipulative perspective, actively pursues to challenge and disrupt the established boundaries within this fictional landscape.
The installation uses a curtain as a symbolic representation of a border wall, embodying the decision-making process in immigration, standing on one side without seeing the other.
            </p>
            The immersive use of light and projection, intensifying the visual experience, creates a captivating narrative. The goal is to make viewers reflect on their perspectives on immigration, highlighting the misleading nature of assumptions by manipulated given context.
"Borderland Subversion" encourages contemplation on the intersection of personal choices and systemic challenges in the pursuit of a better life.

            For our first prototype we explored the concept of the trolley problem (Figure 1), which revolves around decisions that require balancing what's favorable against acceptable sacrifices. For instance, an observer faces the decision to save five people in danger of being hit by a trolley by diverting it to harm just one person. In another scenario, the information is provided that the five people are criminals, and the one person is innocent. The trolley problem is inherently devoid of a clear right or wrong answer. Like many philosophical problems, the Trolley Problem is not designed to provide a solution. Instead, its purpose is to stimulate thought and foster intellectual discourse, appreciating the difficulty of resolving moral dilemmas and recognizing our limitations as moral agents.

                By discovering this concept, we initiated the development of our first prototype for the installation, aligning with our overarching idea of presenting varied perspectives on emigration.

                Both of us contributed to the concept, which depicted immigrants entering the country, showcasing the associated benefits and disadvantages. Simultaneously, we created a scenario where immigrants were prevented from entering by a wall, exploring the advantages and disadvantages of that action as well (Figure 2). I focused on crafting the visuals for the initial prototype. We had to present the prototyphe right after conceptualizing our idea and strive to communicate it on the same day. Although we couldn't illustrate the disadvantages in this first prototype, the plan was already in place for subsequent iterations.

                We received overall positive and valuable feedback, with the most crucial insight suggesting that, since we are portraying different perspectives of emigration, it would be interesting to have similar outcomes for both paths. This implies that the benefits for one side become disadvantages for the other, and vice versa. Given this feedback, we considered creating a completely different prototype involving two separate spaces, each with its context. 
            </p>
            <p class="SynopsisParagraph pt-1">
                Participants would be asked to change to the other space (Figure 5), manipulating them with both sides having advantages and disadvantages. We incorporated this feedback from the first prototype into the concept of the second prototype, where the given context manipulates participants keeping the idea that either paths have the same outcome. Lisa handled the development of visuals for the upcoming prototypes, while we both worked on updating the concept, information, and displayed icons.

                Using a whiteboard (Figure 5), we projected narratives onto both sides of the board. On one side, the narrative depicted people with a lighter in a desert where temperatures were high enough to be life-threatening. On the other side, there was a bottle of water in a place with extremely low temperatures that could lead to death by hypothermia. This illustrated the futility of these objects in their respective situations. In the end, we posed the question of whether they would like to move to the other side, based solely on the context of the benefits of the other side, contrasting with the disadvantages of their current location, manipulating their decision to move (Figure 6).

                Building on this prototype, we received positive and valuable feedback, including a suggestion to make the narrative less abstract, considering we were addressing a fictional situation. To address this, we decided to ground our narrative in a real-life situation and connected it to the World Press Photo 2023 Contest Winners, specifically Carlos Barria's photograph titled "Maria's Journey" the photo that we've chosen from the creative research concept development. Consequently, we used the advantages and disadvantages of the United States of America and Mexico as references in our installation, reflecting on emigration based on the financial, social, and economic states of these countries.

            </p>
            <p class="SynopsisParagraph ">
                Maintaining the system from Prototype 2.1 (Figure 6), where the orange side represented Mexico and the blue side represented the United States of America, our goal wasn't to prompt the audience to identify the topics with those specific countries. Instead, we used them as references to make the narrative less fictional and more relatable. (Figure 7)
            </p>
            <p class="SynopsisParagraph ">
                In this early stages of the project, we received feedback recommending the incorporation of music or sounds into our installation. We engaged in several discussions about the types of sounds to use and when to implement them. We experimented with the sound of heartbeats and the ticking sound of a watch, contemplating how it could enhance the decision-making process towards the end when visitors needed to decide whether to go to the other side.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the final decision-making process, we chose not to include any sound. This decision was based on the consideration that it might be distracting, and, given the visual elements already present, adding sound would be excessive and unnecessary. Further feedback confirmed that we made the right decision by not using any sound.

                The feedback on this version was positive, we've received a green light meaning that in that phase we were in terms of concept successful, but there was still a lot of room for improvement, especially because we didn't have a name for the installation and we wanted to upgrade the physical display of the installation. We've brainstormed about the name and also about the physical installation. (Figure 9)

                The title we chose for this project is "Borderland Subversion." "Borderland" represents an imaginary space that separates two distinct areas or worlds, while "subversion," as a manipulative perspective, actively seeks to challenge and disrupt the established boundaries within this imaginary landscape.

            <p class="SynopsisParagraph pt-1">
                Even without knowing the specific space for projection, we began sketching a hypothetical space that would perfectly suit our vision for the installation (Figure 10). We envisioned a door between two wall spaces, allowing us to project the context on the left side where the audience stands and the manipulative text about the living conditions on the other side on the right. 
            </p>
            <p class="pt-1">
                This setup would encourage them to actively open the centered door to explore the other side instead of going around the whiteboard, as done previously. While this would be our ideal installation if we had that space, we developed an alternative with curtains and a gap between them, creating a gate to the other side. This alternative still maintains the idea of having two walls to project all the information simultaneously, rather than replacing it to display more information, as we did with the vertical whiteboard (Figure 11).

                When we realized that our hypothetical model wouldn't work in the actual space, we began exploring various space layouts and images. We ultimately decided to use curtains and quickly identified the space where it would make the most sense for the project. In the Creative Research class, we had a discussion and recreated the exhibition space on a table using tape. We utilized our models to position them in the space we envisioned (Figure 12).

                    Several improvements were made for Prototypes 2.4 and 2.5, both developed in the same week to accommodate two feedback sessions. In Prototype 2.4, I created a new After Effects project to enhance the visuals. Changes included modifying the font, ensuring consistency in the icons, and maintaining a cohesive visual language (Figure 13).

                    To accentuate the gap further, we employed a zipper opening animation to reveal the text at a certain point in the animation. For the background, instead of using a solid color, we utilized Madmapper with a Normal Map image of blocks, layering the color to complement the border description (Figure 14).

                While setting up the projectors, we discovered that the projection from the opposite side would pass through the gap between the curtains. Capitalizing on this, we created an animated stripe path, using MadMapper functionality, to guide people toward the gap, encouraging them to go through the curtains. This effect was implemented on both sides (Figure 15). Additionally, the same projector that created the path from the opposite side was used to project a wider stripe path animation. This projection on the curtain created a margin when people opened the curtain and also highlighted the gap (Figure 16).
            </p>
            <p class="SynopsisParagraph pt-1"></p>
                To enhance the immersive environment, we incorporated handmade bricks created by wrapping boxes with paper and gluing them. This addition served to enrich the overall ambiance of the installation (Figure 13). To reinforce the idea that people should move through the curtains to access the other side, we incorporated an animation of the curtains opening along with textual support (Figure 16).

            <p class="SynopsisParagraph pt-2">
                I enhanced my proficiency in After Effects by actively exploring new techniques to maximize the program's capabilities, particularly within MadMapper—a software with extensive functionalities that I extensively explored to achieve optimal results. Additionally, I honed my skills in conceptual development throughout the process. We dedicated significant efforts to defining the concept, emphasizing brainstorming, research, and discussions. I believe that our thorough approach allowed us to extract the best possible outcome from this aspect of the project.
            </p>
            <p class="SynopsisParagraph"></p>
            Throughout the 7-week journey of developing the project "Borderland Subversion," our focus was on continuous improvement and adaptability. Each week, we diligently worked to present updated versions, seeking valuable feedback to refine the concept. Working collaboratively, our group demonstrated strong teamwork, sharing tasks equally and actively participating in every step of the process. This ensured that either one of us could seamlessly continue the work if needed.        
        </p>
            <p class="SynopsisParagraph pt-1"></p>
            Balancing differing opinions, we consistently found solutions that aligned with the overarching concept and satisfied both team members. Despite the expected changes and adaptations required for the space, these challenges became highlights of the project. The ability to adapt to circumstances and incorporate public feedback played a crucial role in achieving a consensus version.        
        </p>
            <p class="pt-1">
                During the exhibition, positive feedback from the audience, who were unaware of the behind-the-scenes process, highlighted the clarity and efficiency of the concept. The simplicity of the installation was noted as an asset. While proud of the achieved result, we remained open to further improvements, recognizing that testing with diverse audiences would refine the impact on people. The key focus of making individuals reflect on the concept of "The Grass is Always Greener on the Other Side" and how we manipulated them based on context was successfully executed, and we take pride in the outcome.
