                The inspiration for this project was developed in the Creative Research class, incorporating various concepts and prototyping strategies. The initial strategy involved selecting two images from the World Press Photo 2023 Contest Winners, establishing visual or narrative connections. Subsequently, three questions were formulated about each chosen photograph.
The selected photos were captured by Evgeniy Maloletka and are titled 'Mariupol Maternity Hospital Airstrike' (Figure 1), and by Carlos Barria, titled 'Maria's Journey' (Figure 2).

                    This is the story of Iryna Kalinina (32), an injured pregnant woman who was carried from a maternity hospital that was damaged during a Russian airstrike in Mariupol, Ukraine. Sadly, her baby, named Miron (after the word for 'peace'), was stillborn, and half an hour later, Iryna also passed away.
                    This narrative highlights on the specific conditions in Ukrainian cities following the attacks by Russia. It illustrates the devastating consequences for innocent lives caught in the crossfire of geopolitical conflicts between these countries.

                    This is the story of Maria Hernandez, walking home from shopping in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, while awaiting a decision on her immigration case. Her goal is to travel to the United States to reunite with her daughters. This narrative reflects the painful reality of family separation and children growing up without their relatives due to immigration policies.
                    Maria's body language conveys the profound anguish she feels while awaiting updates on her immigration status that day. The powerful composition, environmental setting, and lighting in the photo align seamlessly with the narrative that the photographer aimed to portray.

                Since the project involved a team of two people, I partnered with Lisa Schneider. We began by brainstorming topics based on both of our selected pictures and identifying similarities and connections. I ended up choosing Carlos Barria's photo, 'Maria's Journey.' We searched into the themes of our photos and then compared our narratives. Additionally, we established connections between our chosen pictures. My partner explored broader subjects such as technology, childcare, and cultural differences, while I focused on emotions like loneliness, imprisonment/restriction, and hopelessness. The common thread we identified was Child Drama/Trauma in certain countries, as depicted on the board below (Figure 3). Exploring social issues and diverse cultures alongside cognitive layers led us to the theme of Child Drama/Trauma in certain countries. We also connected limited access and imprisonment restrictions, concluding that these challenges are less likely to happen in more developed countries.

                Given the requirement to choose one picture, we opted for the photo captured by Carlos Barria, titled 'Maria's Journey.' This image vividly portrayed both the emigration journey and the accompanying emotions experienced by immigrants. Maria's journey with her two daughters to the United States, followed by her deportation and the subsequent waiting for a decision on her immigration case, depicted an uncertain and emotional emigration experience that intrigued us for our main mission project.

                After jointly selecting this picture, we delved deeper into its details, exploring the broader topic of emigration. Returning to our Miro board, we conducted further research, examining various aspects related to the main theme of emigration. We explored relevant articles such as 'Facing Forced Displacement: Overcoming Adverse Childhood Experiences' by Grigoropoulus Iraklis, 'Migration, Social Catastrophes, and Traumas in Argentina.

                In the second week, based on our research, we started developing ideas and concepts for our installation. Once again, we used a mind map to visually organize our thoughts and generate concepts to build the installation around. We discussed our individual mind maps and collectively brainstormed on a Miro board, exploring various possible topics and ideas.

                We concluded that relationships significantly influence our development, especially during our formative years. Additionally, if an individual travels around the world instead of just staying in their home country, it changes their perspective on different cultures and makes them more open to diverse viewpoints from various countries. We chose the idea of 'Life in Your Perspective' and progressed further in developing a concept based on manipulated perspectives that showcase both the negative and positive sides. We started with the idea of a trolley problem and later shifted towards an installation more related to emigration. We made the concept clearer each week until reaching the final point of our installation, which we presented in the final Main Mission exposition.

                The title we chose for this project is "Borderland Subversion." "Borderland" represents an imaginary space that separates two distinct areas or worlds, while "subversion," as a manipulative perspective, actively seeks to challenge and disrupt the established boundaries within this imaginary landscape.
                Even without knowing the specific space for projection, we began sketching a hypothetical space that would perfectly suit our vision for the installation (Figure 10).

                When we realized that our hypothetical model wouldn't work in the actual space, we began exploring various space layouts and images. We ultimately decided to use curtains and quickly identified the space where it would make the most sense for the project. In the Creative Research class, we had a discussion and recreated the exhibition space on a table using tape. We utilized our models to position them in the space we envisioned (Figure 12). The creative process, particularly in defining the concept for our installation, played a crucial role in achieving our goals. We dedicated considerable time to the brainstorming process, research, and refining the concept. Subsequently, the subsequent steps flowed smoothly. Therefore, this phase was integral to the overall development of our Main Mission project installation.
                You can follow the development of the installation based on this foundation in the next project: <a href="MainMission.html">Main Mission - Borderland Subversion</a>.
